# NBA-analysis
For this project I decided to use R to do an analysis of the 2003-2004 season of the NBA. The data I used was gathered with the R SportsAnalytics package, which sources its data fromÂ http://www.dougstats.com. This data includes the players name, team, position, number of games played, total minutes played and 19 other columns pertaining to player performance throughout the season.

Prior to performing any analysis, I chose to review the dataset to look for dirty data and to generate a quick summary of a few stats. I did find and correct three players who had a typo in their team name and also decided to add three calculated columns, the total number of two-point field goals, the points from those goals and the total points from three point shots.
